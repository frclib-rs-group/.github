# FRCLib Group

An organization dedicated to developing FRCLib and associated projects

## Intro

Yes another one, the 8 gajillionth Rust in FRC project. This project throws no shade at [prior](https://github.com/first-rust-competition) or [current](https://github.com/JaciBrunning/robot.rs) art.
I started this project because I wanted to learn more Rust. This project stands on the shoulders of giants, those being the wpilib developers, a majority of
the code in this project is directly inspired by them.

## Getting Some Things Out Of The Way

- This is atrocious PPH (points per hour, a metric for efficiency of work [thanks joey\]).
- I am not pushing for WPILib to support Rust, I am not asking the average high school student to learn Rust.
- This project will not claim to be better than WPILib because it's in Rust, as [we have seen](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Rust-Linux-Maintainer-Step-Down) Rust usage in an established ecosystem can get very emotionally charged.

## Goal
For a variant of each part of the robot stack to be implemented in as much pure rust as possible.
